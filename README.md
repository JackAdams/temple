Developer tool that provides visual information about Meteor templates
----

Based on the work of Sacha Grief, as first seen [on crater.io](http://crater.io/posts/CrigwRm5dfcDE625e)

Quick start
----

```
meteor add babrahams:temple
```

Use [control] + [T] to active __Temple__.

Note:

1. _Temple_ will plug itself into `msavin:mongol` if that package is already added to your project.
2. This is a `debug = true` package, so it won't compile into production builds.
